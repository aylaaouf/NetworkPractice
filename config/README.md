# NetPractice

## 📘 Description
NetPractice is an interactive networking training project from the 42/1337 curriculum.  
Its goal is to teach the fundamentals of computer networking through a series of 10 exercises.  
Each level contains a broken network topology that must be fixed by correctly configuring:

- IPv4 addresses  
- Subnet masks  
- Default gateways  
- Routing tables  

The objective is to understand how packets move through a network and how devices communicate across different subnets.

## 📋 Instructions

### Running the Training Interface
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the project folder.  
3. Launch the training interface by opening **`networkpractice.vercel.app`** in any modern web browser.

### Exporting Configurations
- At the end of each level, click **“get my config”** inside the interface.  
- This will generate a configuration file containing your solution to that level.

### Submission Requirements
- You must export **10 configuration files** (one per level).  
- These **10 files must be placed at the root of your repository** before submitting your project.
